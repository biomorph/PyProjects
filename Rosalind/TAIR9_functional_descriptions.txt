AT1G02580.1	protein_coding	MEA (MEDEA); sequence-specific DNA binding / transcription factor	Encodes a putative transcription factor MEDEA (MEA) that negatively regulates seed development in the absence of fertilization. Mutations in this locus result in embryo lethality.  MEA is a Polycomb group gene that is imprinted in the endosperm.  The maternal allele is expressed and the paternal allele is silent.  MEA is controlled by DEMETER (DME), a DNA glycosylase required to activate MEA expression, and METHYLTRANSFERASE I (MET1), which maintains CG methylation at the MEA locus. MEA is  involved in the negative regulation of its own imprinted gene expression; the effect is not only allele-specific but also  dynamically regulated during seed development.
